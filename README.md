# Heart Disease Prediction and Treatment Recommendation System
This project presents a user-friendly Heart Disease Prediction and Treatment Recommendation System powered by Streamlit. The application is designed to help users assess their heart health by entering key health metrics. Using a machine learning model, the system provides instant predictions of potential heart disease risks and offers personalized treatment recommendations.

# Features
* Interactive User Interface: A clean and intuitive interface built with the Streamlit library.
* Health Data Input: Users can input health parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and more.
* Machine Learning Prediction: A pre-trained ML model analyzes the input data to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
* Personalized Recommendations: Provides tailored treatment suggestions and preventive care tips based on the prediction results.
* Scalable & Modular Design: Easily extendable for additional health parameters or deeper insights.
  
# Tech Stack
* Python
* Streamlit
* Pandas & NumPy
* Scikit-learn 
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (For optional data visualizations)
  
# How It Works
* Input your health details through the Streamlit interface.
* The data is processed and passed to the machine learning model.
* The prediction result is displayed, highlighting the risk level (low, moderate, high).
* Receive personalized recommendations for preventive care or treatment.
  
# Future Scope
* Integration with wearable health devices for real-time monitoring.
* Adding more advanced models for improved prediction accuracy.
* Enhancing recommendations with the latest medical research data.
